## Falu Website & Dashboard

I developed **Falu's website** using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, leveraging powerful tools like **server actions** and **middleware** to ensure dynamic, fast-loading pages and seamless functionality. The website provides comprehensive details about Falu's solutions, including **payments** and **identity verification**.

Additionally, I contributed to the **Falu Dashboard**, which is built with **Next.js** and **Material UI**. I added and enhanced several features, including advanced **user management** and **analytics** functionalities to improve user experience and operational efficiency.

- **Next.js** for dynamic page rendering, server-side rendering, and API routes.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, utility-first design, ensuring a smooth and modern layout.
- **Material UI** for consistent and user-friendly UI components within the Falu Dashboard.
- Integrated advanced **server actions** and **middleware** for optimized performance and security.
- Added **user management** features, improving admin control and team access.
- Enhanced **analytics** functionality to provide real-time insights into user activity and platform usage.
