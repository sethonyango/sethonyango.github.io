## 👋🏽 Hello, I'm Seth Onyango

I’m a passionate and detail-oriented software developer with 7+ years of experience building robust, scalable, and user-centric applications.

At SimpleCloudology, I engineered scalable backend systems for healthcare—specifically cardiology—using Java, Express.js, and secure architecture principles. I also built custom SDKs and identity workflows that powered seamless integrations with sensitive clinical systems.

At Tingle Software, I led initiatives across mobile (React Native & Expo), backend (Java & Python), and frontend (Next.js). From shipping fast, reliable mobile experiences to building performant full-stack apps, I consistently delivered production-ready software that balanced performance, usability, and maintainability.

Alongside this, I’ve worked on projects in AI and Computer Vision, applying machine learning models to tasks like identity verification, face detection, and intelligent automation—often integrating these features into mobile and web platforms.

Whether architecting secure APIs, building responsive UIs, or deploying smart systems, I bring a thoughtful, cross-disciplinary approach to software development.

### 🔬 Highlight: AI & Computer Vision

I’ve worked on cutting-edge **face detection and liveness verification** features in mobile apps, combining **TensorFlow Lite**, **OpenCV**, and platform-specific camera APIs (like **CameraX** on Android). I also collaborated on identity workflows that leverage **ML models** to assess selfie quality, perform document OCR, and streamline KYC compliance for digital onboarding.
